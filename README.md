# Breast-Cancer-Classification
Python, Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project is a Machine Learning classification model developed in the Python programming language using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset.  
It applies the Random Forest Classifier to predict whether a tumor is Malignant (Cancerous) or Benign (Non-Cancerous) based on medical diagnostic measurements.

The project demonstrates strong skills in data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and visualization 

## Dataset
- Source: [Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset (UCI / Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data)
- Target: 
  - `0` → Benign
  - `1` → Malignant
